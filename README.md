AUTHOR: Whitney Williams<br>
REPO NAME: bauhaus<br>

===============================================================================

The goal of this project was to learn how to pull data from an API, manipulate
that data and append it into the page using JavaScript and jQuery. I pulled 
photo data from the Etsy API, then used hover effects to display information
about the product in the photo.

This project was completed while I was a student in The Iron Yard's Front End
Engineeering course.
